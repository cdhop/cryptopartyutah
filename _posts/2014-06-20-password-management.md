### A Common Problem

For most people, the majority of our online accounts are 'secured' through credentials 
that involve some type of username and password combination.  It doesn't take long for
even the most casual online user to accumulate several accounts.  This places many in a
dilemma between security and convenience.  If you use the same credentials for multiple
accounts, then it is easier to remember and manage, but you are more vulnerable to
having multiple accounts being compromised by a singular security breach.  On the other
hand, if you use different credentials for each account, the risk of forgetting them
can increase to the point of being unusable.

Sadly, even if you are doing your best to be secure, if a service you use is compromised
your account(s) could be at risk.  While there are some other approaches which help 
mitigate this risk, they are not yet in widespread use and/or are currently inconvenient. 
Untill something better comes along and displaces them we are left to cope with
traditional credential-based account security.

### Things You Can Do

Password length and using mixed characters (such as upper and lower case letters, numbers, 
and special characters) are important in securing your accounts.  Cyber criminals 
use dictionary and brute force attacks to compromise accounts.  Using uncommon, long 
passwords can go a long way to frustrate their efforts.

Making sure that your account credentials are sent using encryption is also important.
If you send your credentials over an unencrypted connection, anyone in a position
to view the traffic could obtain your credentials.  Make sure that sites
you login are protected using SSL.  As a rule, avoid sharing anything
important on websites that are not secured (Look for a 'padlock' icon near the site's 
address in most popular browsers).
  
Several high-profile services have been breached, and it is only a matter of time
before others experience the same fate.  Protect yourself by using different credentials
for each of your accounts.  This will mitigrate the risk of multiple accounts being 
compromised one service is undermined.

### Password Managers

Unless you have a photography memory, maintaining a list of all your credentials can
be overwhelming.  Writing them down would help, but then you would run the risks of
losing your list, not having it available when you need it, and/or being compromised.

Tools exist which can help us protect both our online security and sanity.  These tools 
are known as password managers.  Thses tools can vary from hardware devices to
software applications, from proprietary to open source solutions.  They are usually
secured using a password, or token.  While we may still need to use and remember
a strong password, at least it is only one (not ten or more).

Before selecting one, take into consideration your needs.  Do you need it to be 
multiplatform (Windows/MacOS/Linux)?  Do you need it to be available for both
desktop and mobile devices?  How would you create (and store) a backup?

Most password managers can auto-generate very strong passwords for you.  Some
can be integrated into your browsers.  Some share common file formats, so that
you can use different managers with the same list file.

### Conclusion

Implementing good password management can greatly improve your online security.
Password managers can go a long way to make it easier to be more secure online.  

Find one that works for you, and use it.
