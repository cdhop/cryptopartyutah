DEF CON is the world's largest hacker conference held annually in the first part of August in Las Vegas.  While not technically in Utah, DEF CON is near enough for people in the state to attend.  This year's conference will be held at Bally's on the 6th through 9th of August. 

DEF CON has several 'villages' that focus on specific interests (hardware hacking, lockpicking, etc), among these will be the Crypto & Privacy Village.  Last year, the Crypto and Privacy Village held several presentations, workshops, dicussions, and keysigning parties (think of it as a super crypto party). 

This is a great opportunity to learn how to protect yourself online, and associate with others who are passionate about security and privacy.
