On this, the first anniversary of the Snowden revelations, we announce the formation of CryptoParty - Utah.  Many people have become concerned 
about their online privacy, but don't know what they can do to protect it.  We will be holding an ongoing series of events, where we can learn 
to protect our online privacy through the use of cryptographic tools, and security practices.

There are several tools and resources available to help us, but learning about what's available, and how to effectively use them can be a 
challenge.  We want to enable people to overcome such challenges so that they can use technology and be in control of their online privacy.

Please join and help us.  If you have mastered a technology/tool which would help others protect their online privacy, then please conduct a 
workshop and help others.  There are a number of tools/techniques we have planned to present already, but we are always open to more.

Our inaugural meeting will be anounced shortly, so please visit us again soon.
